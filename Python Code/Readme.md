# Description of files 

* X-ray images of coral virtual slabs used in this study [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data)


* ROI.zip files containing tracings of maximum growth axes tracks on virtual slabs [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data). 
A single ROI.zip file can be superimposed onto its corresponding virtual slab for visualisation of tracings using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). The results of extracted measurements on slabs are in [ROI_extraction_results.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_SST_Reconstructions/blob/811cc5006c0a84d66b65052fa2c30344851c30a3/Data/ROI_extraction_results.xlsx) 


* Extracted environmental variables for all reef sites used in this study and existing literature are included as part of Excel spreadsheets
  * SST_Extract_Results_...xlsx
  * DSR_Extracted_Results_...xlsx
  * Kd490_Extracted_Results_...xlsx


* Indo-Pacific Warm Pool SST anomalies extracted from D'Arrigo et al. (2009) are in [IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_SST_Reconstructions/blob/c4b77aa746635c91fd8eca7461cfa2f973347977/Data/IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx)
