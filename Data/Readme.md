- X-ray images of coral virtual slabs used in this study [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data)

- ROI.zip files containing tracings of maximum growth axes tracks on virtual slabs [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data). 
A single ROI.zip file can be superimposed onto its corresponding virtual slab for visualisation of tracings using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). The results of extracted measurements on slabs are in [ROI_extraction_results.xlsx]() 

- Extracted environmental variables for all reef sites used in this study and existing literature are included as part of Excel spreadsheets. 
- Indo Pacifc Warm Pool SST anomalies extracted from D'Arrigo et al. (2009) are in [IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_SST_Reconstructions/blob/c4b77aa746635c91fd8eca7461cfa2f973347977/Data/IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx)
