# Description of files 

* X-ray images of coral virtual slabs used in this study [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/PoritesGrowthBaselines)

* ROI.zip files containing tracings of maximum growth axes tracks on virtual slabs [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/PoritesGrowthBaselines). 
A single ROI.zip file can be superimposed onto its corresponding virtual slab for visualisation of tracings using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/). The results of extracted measurements on slabs are in [ROI_extraction_results.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_SST_Reconstructions/blob/811cc5006c0a84d66b65052fa2c30344851c30a3/Data/ROI_extraction_results.xlsx) 


* Extracted environmental variables for all reef sites used in this study and existing literature are included as part of Excel spreadsheets
  * Extract_Results_SST_DSR_Kd490_MuseumSpecimens.xlsx 
  * Extract_Results_SST_DSR_Kd490_Literature.xlsx


* Indo-Pacific Warm Pool SST anomalies extracted from D'Arrigo et al. (2009) are in [IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data/IPWP_ExtractedAnomalies.xlsx)
