## [Data](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data)

- X-ray images of coral virtual slabs used in this study [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data)

- ROI.zip files containing tracings of maximum growth axes tracks on virtual slabs [can be accessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data). 
A single ROI.zip file can be superimposed onto its corresponding virtual slab for visualisation of tracings using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).

- Extracted environmental variables for all reef sites used in this study and existing literature are included as part of Excel spreadsheets and [can be accsessed here](https://github.com/LeoBertiniNHM/CoralTriangle_PoritesGrowthBaselines/Data)
